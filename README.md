The following code is used for reporting the following from a Javascript file:

1. undeclared variables in a code
2. oneline if..else statements
3. undeclared functions
4. unbalanced paranthesis in the code

For running the code, an input JavaScript file is required.
This file is given as an argument to the python code which parses the file.

To run the code through Command Prompt:

Navigate to the folder where the javascript_parser.py file is located
Run the file using the command: "python javascript_parser.py test.js"
test.js is the input file to be parsed.
